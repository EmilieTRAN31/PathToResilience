# The Path To Resilience

This is a first-person interactive puzzle game created as part of a master’s program assignment. The game was built from scratch in just a few weeks by a team of two.


Your objective is to move through a sequence of rooms, each containing a puzzle that reveals new information every time you attempt it. Success requires persistence: each failure teaches you something new, and solving a puzzle on the first try is nearly impossible.
